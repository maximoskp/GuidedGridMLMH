# GuidedGridMLMH
Melodic harmonization with GridMLMH guided by examples.

## Training steps
1. Train with a specific melodic harmonization. Input to the transformer encoder is the melody and to the guiding LSTM is the harmony. The transformer encoder should learn to compose the harmony. This is performed by running *train_all.py*.
2. Generate 10,000 melodic harmonizations with the models trained in the first step. These melodic harmonizations are generated by selecting 1000 random melodies and 10 random guiding harmonies for each (all from the training set). Aim of this step is to create an artificial dataset that will fine-tune the model to learn to disentangle the melody requirements from the guiding harmony directions. This is performed by running *generate_disentanglement_dataset.py*.
3. Train on the disentanglement dataset.
4. TODO: if it makes sense: An alternative would be to create a live disentanglement loop, where the model generates new 10-tuples of guided harmonizations in each batch, as/while it is training. This way, it is harder to overfit in specific examples and the examples become more fine-grained as the epochs progress.
