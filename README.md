# GuidedGridMLMH
Melodic harmonization with GridMLMH guided by examples.

## Training steps
1. Train with a specific melodic harmonization. Input to the transformer encoder is the melody and to the guiding LSTM is the harmony. The transformer encoder should learn to compose the harmony. This is performed by running *train_all.py*.
2. Generate 20,000 melodic harmonizations with the models trained in the first step. These melodic harmonizations are generated by selecting 1000 random melodies and 20 random guiding harmonies for each (all from the training set). Aim of this step is to create an artificial dataset that will fine-tune the model to learn to disentangle the melody requirements from the guiding harmony directions. This is performed by running *generate_disentanglement_dataset.py*.
3.
