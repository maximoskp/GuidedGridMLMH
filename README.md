# GuidedGridMLMH
Melodic harmonization with GridMLMH guided by examples.

## Training steps
1. Train with a specific melodic harmonization. Input to the transformer encoder is the melody and to the guiding LSTM is the harmony. The transformer encoder should learn to compose the harmony. This is performed by running `train_all.py`.
2. Generate 10,000 melodic harmonizations with the models trained in the first step. These melodic harmonizations are generated by selecting 500 random melodies and 20 random guiding harmonies for each (all from the training set). Aim of this step is to create an artificial dataset that will fine-tune the model to learn to disentangle the melody requirements from the guiding harmony directions. This is performed by running `generate_disentanglement_dataset.py`.
3. Train on the disentanglement dataset by running `train_disentangle_all.py`.
4. Generate the experiment data by doing inference with all versions of the original and the disentangled model on cross harmonizations between the test set and the jazz set; this is done by running `experiments_guidance.py`.
5. Run specific comparisons with `experiments_comparisons.ipynb`.
